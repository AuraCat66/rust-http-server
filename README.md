# Rust HTTP server

## What's this?

A (very) basic and experimental [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)
server made from scratch, no HTTP library (only the TCP stuff in the standard
library).

Not a serious project by any means.

Do not use any part of the code for any serious intents. I won't take
responsability for any issues caused by my code lol. Also I can't guarantee that
my code has no security issues.

I warned you.

## How? Why? When?

Uhhh [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[official standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html),
[my brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain), some online documentation
(thanks [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)). (I hope that's a good
enough answer).

Well, I'm doing that for learning purposes, and also for fun!

Weird question, but I started on May 30th 2025...?

## How do I use it?

Don't, but if you really insist:

For now it compiles as a standalone executable (but it might become a Rust
library with tests and stuff).

Make sure you have Cargo/the Rust toolchain installed. Then just clone or
download the repository and use `cargo run` and it'll run.

By default it will use the address `127.0.0.1` (aka `localhost`, aka your own
computer) with port `8000`.

Though note that there's no routes or anything (yet) for now, it just responds
to any request with a basic sorta "placeholder" request.
